Given the situation, the priority should be to inform the clients about the delay and apologize for the inconvenience caused.

For Task 2, since it's for a priority customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days, it is crucial to inform them as soon as possible about the delay and provide an updated timeline for the completion of the task. It would be best to try and complete the task as soon as possible, and if needed, allocate additional resources to meet the new deadline.

For Task 1, since it's for a low-priority customer who has not provided any go-live date, it may be possible to extend the deadline by a few days. However, it is still essential to inform the client about the delay and provide an updated timeline for the completion of the task. It would also be a good idea to prioritize Task 2 and allocate resources accordingly, with Task 1 being completed once Task 2 is done.

Overall, communication with both clients is critical in this situation, as well as prioritizing the task for the priority customer whose campaign needs to go live soon.
